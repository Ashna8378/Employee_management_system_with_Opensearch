## **Goal**  
This project sets up **OpenSearch** using **Podman** (a container system), inserts **100,000 records** using a **Python script**, and provides a **web-based CRUD interface** built with **Express.js**. Users must **log in** before accessing CRUD functionalities.

## **Table of Contents**  
- **TC 1**: Set up OpenSearch in Podman  
- **TC 2**: Verify OpenSearch Cluster Health  
- **TC 3**: Insert Bulk Data into OpenSearch  
- **TC 4**: Validate Data Insertion in OpenSearch  
- **TC 5**: Implement User Authentication (Login Page)  
- **TC 6**: Verify Authentication Flow  
- **TC 7**: Test CRUD Operations via Web Interface  
  - **TC 7.1**: Create Operation  
  - **TC 7.2**: Read Operation  
  - **TC 7.3**: Update Operation  
  - **TC 7.4**: Delete Operation  
- **TC 8**: API Security & Authentication Check  
- **TC 9**: OpenSearch Query Performance Testing  

---

## **Test Environment**  
- **Platform**: Podman (for running OpenSearch in a container)  
- **Backend**: Express.js (handles API requests)  
- **Database**: OpenSearch  
- **Frontend**: Web interface for CRUD operations

## **Test Cases**  

### **TC 1: Set Up OpenSearch in Podman**  
**Scenario**  
Ensure OpenSearch is running inside a Podman container.  

**Given**  
- Podman is installed on the system.  

**When**  
- The command to download and run OpenSearch in Podman is executed.  

**Then**  
- The OpenSearch container starts successfully.  
- Running `podman ps` displays OpenSearch as active.  

**Testing Outputs**  
(Screenshot showing the running container)

### **TC 2: Verify OpenSearch Cluster Health**  
**Scenario**  
Check if OpenSearch is functioning properly.  

**Given**  
- OpenSearch is running in a container.  

**When**  
- The `GET /_cluster/health` API is called.  

**Then**  
- The API returns a `"green"` or `"yellow"` status, indicating that OpenSearch is healthy.

**Testing Outputs**  
(JSON response from the OpenSearch cluster health check)

### **TC 3: Validate Data Insertion in OpenSearch**  
**Scenario**  
Verify that OpenSearch correctly stores all 100,000 records.  

**Given**  
- Bulk data insertion was successful.  

**When**  
- The `GET /index_name/_count` API is called.  

**Then**  
- The API returns **100,000** records.  

**Testing Outputs**  
(JSON response showing the total records)
